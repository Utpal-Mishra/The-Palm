        <p>WHAT IS A PALM LEAF? The Palm Leaves are created from the leaf of a palmyra palm tree. If you want to learn more about the actual palm trees, you can visit the following link and read about them ~here.

Palm trees are found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates, and they are native to both the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

WHY USE A PALM LEAF? If the leaf of the palm tree is maintained using the correct method, they can withstand much time and last through the ages!

HOW DOES THE PALM LEAF BECOME A PALM LEAF MANUSCRIPT? A special method is used to choose any palm leaves that will go on to be used for a manuscript. The leaf should not be too tender or too matured. Once an appropriate leaf is chosen, it is cut into the required shape, and is then cooked in sacred water (pure river water) or milk. After this they are shade-dried, which is important because direct sunlight can make the palm leaf brittle, meaning it may not then withstand being written on. Once the leaf is completely dried, it is then pressed with wooden planks to level and flatten it, the corners are trimmed, and the leaf is polished.

Following this, small holes are made at the ends and chords are passed through the holes. Two wooden planks are then prepared according to the dimensions of the palm leaf and placed on both ends, similar to a cardboard cover that we often place on either side of books to protect them. Now the palm leaf is ready for the author to express his knowledge upon it. The author writes onto the leaf using a pointed metal stylus, similar to the one in the photo below.

WHEN WERE PALM LEAF MANUSCRIPTS USED? For the most part, processed manuscript palm leaves were used in the olden days, just like we would use paper in the present day. Palm leaf manuscripts were used from as far back as 80 million years ago! Normally the palm leaf manuscript has a life span of 300-350 years, therefore before a palm leaf decays the manuscript is carefully copied on to a new palm leaf to preserve the information and wisdom for the next generation to hear.

In conclusion, after talking through many aspects regarding these fascinating palm leaves, we hope you have learnt something new today!

WHY USE A PALM LEAF? WHAT KIND OF CONTENT WAS WRITTEN ONTO PALM LEAVES? LITERATURE:

The works of literature in the palm leaf manuscripts render lots of information regarding letters, the grammar of poetry, and prose. There were also literary works ranging from epic to short stories, and the authors wrote from real-time incidents to imaginary works. In the monarchy period, many kings tasked authors with the creation of these literatures. Sangam literature was a very old literary work in the Tamil language.

ART: Many talented artistic people wrote about their skills in palm leaf manuscripts as a way to hand down their knowledge to future generations. In the present day we have various different platforms and resources to spread knowledge, but 1000's of years ago this is what the palm leaf manuscripts were used for. These talented people would also have periodic meetings to share their skills with others, similar to how we hold conferences in the modern day. For example - the Natya Sastra by an ancient scholar called Bharatha Muni. Natya Sastra was purely about the Indian classical dance "Bharathanatyam".

MATHEMATICS: Great mathematicians also bestowed their knowledge upon future generations through palm leaf manuscripts. From complicated concepts to simple terms, the information can amaze us as we wonder - how had they written such simple solutions to such complex problems? There are manuscripts regarding the decimal systems, numeral notations, measurements and algorithms.

SCIENCE: My favourite subject has come - science! There are literary works ranging from nanoscience to macro objects found within the palm leaf libraries. There are works about medicine, physics, chemistry and astronomy. Siddha, Ayurveda, and Unani manuscripts contribute to the medicine works, and there are also books regarding civil engineering (Vastu Sastra), architecture, atomic theory and metallurgy etc.

PHILOSOPHY AND LIFE SCIENCE: In the ancient period, people had a simple and structured lifestyle where they lived a self sustainable life. There are numerous literary works regarding the different types of people who lived in different geographical landscapes. The authors wrote about the life, food, and love of the people who lived in those areas. Also, when kings, leaders or people were moving toward a misleading path, the authors considered it as their duty to guide them. For this they wrote philosophical works to help normalize and assist society.

WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGES WERE USED? There are palm leaf manuscripts written in Tamil, Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, Persian, Arabic, Urdu, Marathi, Malayalam, Telugu, and Kannada.

WHO WERE SOME OF THE AUTHORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PALM LEAF MANUSCRIPTS? The different authors ranged from the Maharishis, to the Siddhars, to scholars from various fields. The Maharishis wrote knowledgeable works from spirituality to materialistic life. Siddhars were scientists, saints, doctors, alchemists and mystical writers. Scholars wrote about arts, architecture, music, dance, and sculptures. While many palm leaf manuscripts that were written still exist, preserved in libraries, unfortunately many have been lost due to enmity, natural disasters or insects.

In conclusion, we now know there are many palm leaf manuscripts written about a large number of different topics, in different languages, and by various authors of different ages. Palm leaf libraries are rich in knowledge, lessons and stories that hold the power to teach and sometimes astonish us with each word we read.
